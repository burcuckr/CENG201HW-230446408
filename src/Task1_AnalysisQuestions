My Code Output;
This id is found. Patient informations are: Işıl Ünal, 44, 2
Patient Id: 1 Patient name: Arda Mutlu Patient severity: 5 Patient age: 19
Patient Id: 2 Patient name: Sevgi Günaytürk Patient severity: 9 Patient age: 25
Patient Id: 3 Patient name: Açelya Demir Patient severity: 10 Patient age: 29
Patient Id: 4 Patient name: Işıl Ünal Patient severity: 2 Patient age: 44

Time Complexity;

-AddPatient: This method time complexity is O(n).Because while doing n operations if we have 5 patient while runs 5 times after this situation O(n). But we have 2 ways to
write this method if we add the new patient at the begining in the list our Big O is O(1) but first patient to get treatement at the end and this is nonsensical.

-RemovePatient: This method time complexity is O(n) because in this method iterate through the entire cycle using a while loop.

-FindPatient: Again our time complexity is O(n) becuse this method iterate through the entire cycle using a while loop. If we have 100 patient and method seach id 100
this methods runs 100 times and finally find another example is we search id 40 and loop runs 40 times. Our complexity is O(n).

-PrintList: Time complexity is O(n). Because if we have 50 patients this code prints 50 times. If we have n patients this code prints n times.

+ Our all codes depends on number of patient also all methods time complexity is O(n).
